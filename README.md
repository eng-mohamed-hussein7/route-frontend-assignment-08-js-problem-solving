# 🧮 JavaScript Problem Solving — Assignment 8

This project includes 20 **JavaScript exercises** designed to strengthen logical thinking and core programming concepts.  
Each question is solved inside a single `.js` file, clearly separated by comments.

---

## 📚 Overview
The assignment focused on building logic using only core JS features — without any built-in functions.  
Topics covered:
- Input/output handling
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `switch`)
- Arithmetic operations
- Problem-solving logic

---

## ✨ Example Tasks
- Check if a number is **divisible by 3 and 4**
- Find the **maximum** and **minimum** between numbers
- Determine if a number is **even or odd**
- Display all numbers up to a given input
- Generate a **multiplication table**
- Create a simple **calculator** using `switch`
- Assign **grades** based on percentage

---

## ⚙️ Rules
- All solutions written in **one JS file**.
- Each problem separated by a clear comment block.
- No built-in math functions (`Math.pow`, `Math.max`, etc.).
- Emphasis on **pure logic** and understanding of control flow.

## 💡 What I Learned
- Strengthened problem-solving skills in JavaScript.  
- Gained a deeper understanding of loops, conditions, and logic flow.  
- Practiced writing clean, readable code with comments.  
- Built confidence in debugging and testing directly in the console.
